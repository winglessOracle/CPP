# C++ Modules | CODAM Amsterdam

In 9 modules we learn the fundamentals of C++ coming from C we focus on the switch to OOP.
There are no to library use and there is no Norm that is enforced.
We are stimulated to work with the C++98 standard.

I added the subject assignments for background on the assignments.
